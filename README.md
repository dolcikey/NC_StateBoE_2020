## 2020 Election: North Caroline Early Voting and Absentee Data

In preparation for tomorrow, Election Day in the United States, I took the time to learn how to build a dashboard in Tableau. Having only used Seaborn/Matplotlib libraries for my previous data analyses, I thought the best way to learn was to jump in the deep end.

### Why North Carolina? 
North Carolina is a swing state, and in addition to the Presidential election, has competitive House races in their 8th, 9th, and 11th congressional districts, where once safe House Republicans find themselves suddenly in competitive races following the redistricting of Congressional Districts in 2019.

Additionally, North Carolina is one of the most transparent states when it comes to public election data with multiple CSV files available with both county and congressional districts (the hardest data to find as they are subject to change with redistricting which often contain split counties).
